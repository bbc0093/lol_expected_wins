# lol_expected_wins

An ongoing project to explore creating an expected win percentage metric for League of Legends similar to that of [Fangraphsâ€™ Baseball Win Expectancy](https://library.fangraphs.com/misc/we/).

## Description

The overall goal of this project is to explore the various ways that the outcome of a game of League of Legends can be tracked. Right now that means familiarizing myself with parsing game logs and charting win percentage vs gold and XP difforental. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

As of (10/8/2021) the only dependency is having a large number of game logs stored as files. 

For a script that scrapes game logs look: [HERE](https://github.com/bbc0093/riot_lol_games_scrape)
